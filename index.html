                        _lead">When I was in seventh grade my father somehow borrowed an Apple II+ computer. It came with
                            16k of memory
                            (count the bytes, folks), a 4" black and white portable tv monitor and a cassete tape drive
                            for
                            storage. We tinkered around for a while with it. Then I locked myself into the basement for
                            two weeks
                            and emerged a BASIC programmer. That's how all this started.</p>
                        <p class="_lead">In high school I experienced a crisis. College was directly ahead of me and I had to make
                            some hard
                            choices. I studied voice and seriously considered majoring in Vocal
                            Performance. On the other hand, Computer Science and Mathematics was attractive, too. There
                            didn't seem
                            to be a way to do all of them together. A Vocal major would likely end up with me in a
                            cardboard box on
                            Lower Wacker drive. CS/Math would provide me with food and shelter. I'm very big on food and
                            thrive on
                            shelter. That made my decision for me.</p>
                        <p class="_lead">I've been in the software business for over 25 years, starting in C, moving to C++, then lots
                            of Java.
                            Now I'm looking for an opportunity to expand my horizons with full-stack web development.

                            school
                            football games, going to the opera and symphony and finding the best source of dried kiwi.
